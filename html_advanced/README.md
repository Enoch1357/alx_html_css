This project is centered on HTML.

It demonstrates how this markup language can be used to build a website.

In this project, we're using it only to create a *wireframe*, which is like the outline or skeleton of a webpage. _image.jpg_ file in this directory contains the wireframe we're trying to build.

CSS is also employed in this process; *external CSS* to be precise and then, the html file and the css file were linked so they can be rendered simultaneously on the browser.

The _index.html_ file in this directory contains the html file for this project.

The _styles.css_ file in the sub directory *css* contains the css file for this project.

Thank you.
